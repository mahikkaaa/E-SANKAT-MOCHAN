“E-SANKAT MOCHAN” : AI-based Machine Service Appointing app


A one-stop commercial Service appointing app for all the electronic appliances the company uses. 

The idea is to develop an AI-based application that would proactively schedule a servicing appointment for a machine the company uses before it breaks down and causes any accident. 

The model does so by predicting the breakdown of the particular machine from the data input of the name of the machine, its model number and also how in the past at what particular stage has the model broken down and has needed repairs. This is done by providing the datasets to the model of past breakdowns of machines in the companies which helps in its accurate prediction. Post this the application then will contact the service in need from the database if notified that the machine needs a service immediately. 



The programme will get knowledge from previous experiences of various users about how long the equipment required maintenance before any accidents occurred.


For instance, the ABC Company, a car manufacturer, uses the xyz machine to form the bonnets of its automobiles. Based on previous experiences by the firms using the xyz equipment for the same task, the app will predict when the machine needs repair before any harm is done to the workers and book the appointment.
